- Looking at the data in Excel after some slight formatting adjustments for better readability
- There is way too much categorical data so I'll have to do some preprocessing and turn the categorical data numerical
- Looking at how exactly the features look and if they can/should be numerically labeled automatically or not
- Renamed all the features with much shorter names to make working with them easier
- Dividing all features into three main categories: numerical, ordered categorical and textual
- Looking at some correlations between the locations (work, living) and professional diagnosis to decide if this may have any impact on the mental health
    -> All correlations are at ~|.1| or lower, thus, there probably will not be any impact of the location people work or live in on their mental health
    -> Also done with work_position, to see if any particular field may suffer more or less from mental health, correlation of 0.029449
    -> Reduced dimensionality (d63->d54)

- Imputed missing data for a few features. Removed features with too much missing data
    -> Reduced dimensionality (d54->d52)

- Started working on dimensionality reduction using PCA and looking at correlation between features
    -> removed correlated features with lower variance (d52 -> d47)

- Noticed what a mess the gender feature was so returned to normalization and divided all genders into 3 categories: male/female/divers/undefined - sue me
